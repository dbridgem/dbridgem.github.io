	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		I'm currently a Doctor of Chemical Engineering working at a<a href="http://breezing.com/"> small startup in the Phoenix area</a>. 
		I earned my Bachelor's and Doctorate of Philosophy in Chemical Engineering at Arizona State University, then took a position at TF Health Corporation
		developing sensors to guide health-related lifestyle decisions. The flagship product of TF Health Co. is the Breezing Tracker,
		which is a breath-based device that utilizes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_calorimetry">indirect calorimetry</a> 
		to measure metabolism.</p>
	
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		I started at ASU in 2009 getting my undergraduate, and started actual lab work in 2012 as a volunteer. After a few months I 
		was offered a position, which is when I started working a fair bit with data in Matlab. After I graduated, I started as
		a Research Assistant in my PhD.. During my PhD. I worked on several projects, with my dissertation being on developing an 
		inexpensive carbon dioxide colorimetric sensor. This project was mostly building a model to account for temperature, moisture, 
		and transport delays in a sensor system where none of these things could actually be measured all that well by reference methods. </p>
		
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		After I graduated, I started working at TF Health Corporation, where I worked to develop the second generation of their 
		flagship product. This is when I started to branch out: At this point I'm proficient with Python, SQL, Matlab, R, HTML/CSS, C, 
		and others. This is also when I started to apply more machine learning techniques. At this point I am proficient with 
		most common machine learning techniques: linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees / random forests, support 
		vector machines and regressions, artificial neural nets, nearest neighbor classification (KNN), and many more. </p>
	
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		I am a capable data scientist looking for my next challenge. For more detail on some related projects see the project page above 
		or take a look at my resume. Thanks for stopping by.</p>
