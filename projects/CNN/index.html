		The flagship technology at my current company is color-based breath sensing. Basically, you breath in the device, 
		the sensor reacts with the O2 and CO2 in your breath, and we look at the color change due to the reaction. The way 
		we manufacture these color-based sensors is by depositing these chemicals on a plastic substrate. Since the chemicals 
		are colored, this makes visual or imaging-based systems ideal for finding sensors that do not meet our standards. 
		Currently, this is all done visually by an operator; however we want to have a method that is not dependent on the 
		operator and can be easily scaled. For this, a camera with a convolutional neural net is a great candidate.

	<p>	From this animated bar graph showing the most popular words over time, I found a few things interesting. First, you can see 
		that over time there are a few words that become popular and remain popular. Second, you can see that the most popular terms
		rotate very quickly towards the beginning of the publication, and later they stabilize a fair bit.

		If we look at the average length of a title over time from published Letters, we can see a fairly steady increase from 
		about 4 words per title in 1874 to almost 11 words per title in 1984, when it stopped increasing.

		Looking at the volume of Letters that Nature published over time, we are currently seeing a long decrease, where we might 
		even expect to see a lower rate in the near future than we did in the late 1800's. There is quite an increase from 1920 to 1960,
		then a spike and peak in the 1960's.
