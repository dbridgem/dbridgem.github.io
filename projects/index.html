<div class="project">
	<h2>Nature Scraping</h2>
	<iframe width="300" height="300" style="padding: 0 15px; float:left" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KNJ-Nv17IgQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

	<p>In this project I was curious to see what some of the trends in popular topics in scientific literature over time were. Since Nature
	is a top journal and has been publishing for a very long time, it was a perfect candidate. Using Beautiful Soup 4 in Python, I was
	able to scrape the entirety of the journal archives and  with a few other Python scripts I was able to extract the frequency of different
	words used over time. What I found was that in earlier years (around 1900), the literature was much more diverse in topics, and 
	recently we start to see the same popular terms. It's not really a surprise when you think about it, but still interesting.
	Here is an animated plot showing some of the top terms over time. <a href="/nature_scraper"> Click here to read more </a></p>

	<h2>CNN for Sensor Quality Control</h2>
	<p><img style = "padding: 0 15px; float: right;" img src = "300.png" alt ="Image_Placeholder.png" height = 300 width = 300/>

	<h2>Animated Bar Graph Generator</h2>
	
	<p><img style = "padding: 0 15px; float: left;" img src = "300.png" alt ="Image_Placeholder.png" height = 300 width = 300/>
	So don't you hate when you want to make an awesome animated chart (lake for some word trends over time) and you aren't 
	familiar with R (yet)? This is a nice little Python script using PIL that will take a data input from a formatted CSV
	document and convert it to an awesome animated bar graph. Here is a GIF with some random numbers and titles to demonstrate.
	There isn't a whole lot to talk about on this one, <a href="https://github.com/dbridgem/ABGG"> so here is a github link to the code </a></p>
