	<h2>Nature Scraping</h2>
	<iframe width="300" height="300" style="padding: 0 15px; float:left" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KNJ-Nv17IgQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

	<p>In this project I was curious to see what some of the trends in popular topics in scientific literature over time were. Since Nature
	is a top journal and has been publishing for a very long time, it was a perfect candidate. Using Beautiful Soup 4 in Python, I was
	able to scrape the entirety of the journal archives and  with a few other Python scripts I was able to extract the frequency of different
	words used over time. What I found was that in earlier years (around 1900), the literature was much more diverse in topics, and 
	recently we start to see the same popular terms. It's not really a surprise when you think about it, but still interesting.
	Here is an animated plot showing some of the top terms over time. <a href="/nature_scraper"> Click here to read more. </a></p>

	<h2>CNN for Sensor Quality Control</h2>
	<p><img style = "padding: 0 15px; float: right;" img src = "300.png" alt ="Image_Placeholder.png" height = 300 width = 300/>
	So the company I work for manufactures color-based sensors, and we want to find a better way to determine if a sensor is
	good or bad. The way these sensors are manufactured is in sheets of 16 sensors, so the idea is that we can snap a picture and
	have a trained convolutional neural net determine which (if any) of the sensors should be discarded based on visible defects. 
	To make this, I started with a simple script to ensure the photos were all the in the right orientation, divided the photots
	into 16 areas (1 area per sensor), let a user select if the sensor passed or failed qc in a window (tkinter) to generate 
	class labels, then ran a convolutional neural net to predict pass or fail based on image alone. <a href="/CNN"> Click here to read more. </a></p>

	<h2>Animated Bar Graph Generator</h2>
	
	<p><img style = "padding: 0 15px; float: left;" img src = "300.png" alt ="Image_Placeholder.png" height = 300 width = 300/>
	So don't you hate when you want to make an awesome animated chart (lake for some word trends over time) and you aren't 
	familiar with R (yet)? This is a nice little Python script using PIL that will take a data input from a formatted CSV
	document and convert it to an awesome animated bar graph. Here is a GIF with some random numbers and titles to demonstrate.
	There isn't a whole lot to talk about on this one, <a href="https://github.com/dbridgem/ABGG"> so here is a github link to the code. </a></p>

<div class="project">
	<h2>Baseline Tracking Comparison</h2>
	<p><img style = "padding: 0 15px; float: right;" img src = "300.png" alt ="Image_Placeholder.png" height = 300 width = 300/>
	So at the company I work for we do breath analysis in wearable devices. An issue with flow in particular is how we measure it, which is with 
	a differential pressure flow meter. The issue with this type of sensor is that it can have issues with baseline drift, especially 
	if the sensor experiences movement (like you would expect in a wearable device). Since we have a one-way valve, we know that when
	the person is inhaling that we are at baseline. The question is: How do we determine when the person is inhaling? We had an algorithm
	developed for a microcontroller but we wanted to ensure it was working properly, so this algorithm uses Python to generate a reference
	for accurate assessment of baseline vs. exhalation breathing. <a href="/baseline_tracking"> Click here to read more. </a></p>
