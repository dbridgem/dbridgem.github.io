	<p>Here is a brief summary on a Convolutional Neural Net project I made. <a href="https://github.com/dbridgem/Sensor_CNN">Click

		Why did I look at this?

		The flagship technology at my current company is color-based breath sensing. Basically, you breath in the device, 
		the sensor reacts with the O2 and CO2 in your breath, and we look at the color change due to the reaction. The way 
		we manufacture these color-based sensors is by depositing these chemicals on a plastic substrate. Since the chemicals 
		are colored, this makes visual or imaging-based systems ideal for finding sensors that do not meet our standards. 
		Currently, this is all done visually by an operator; however we want to have a method that is not dependent on the 
		operator and can be easily scaled. For this, a camera with a convolutional neural net is a great candidate.
