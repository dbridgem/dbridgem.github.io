	<p>	From this animated bar graph showing the most popular words over time, I found a few things interesting. First, you can see 
		that over time there are a few words that become popular and remain popular. Second, you can see that the most popular terms
		rotate very quickly towards the beginning of the publication, and later they stabilize a fair bit.

<div class="finding">
	<h2>
		Letter titles have gotten longer over time.
	</h2>
	<p><img style = "padding: 0 15px; float: left;" img src = "Title_length.jpg" alt ="Image_Placeholder.png" height = 300 width = 300/>
		If we look at the average length of a title over time from published Letters, we can see a fairly steady increase from 
		about 4 words per title in 1874 to almost 11 words per title in 1984, when it stopped increasing.

<div class="finding">
	<h2>
		Nature doesn't publish many more Letters now that in the late 1800's
	</h2>
	<p><img style = "padding: 0 15px; float: left;" img src = "Num_Letters.jpg" alt ="Image_Placeholder.png" height = 300 width = 300/>
		Looking at the volume of Letters that Nature published over time, we are currently seeing a long decrease, where we might 
		even expect to see a lower rate in the near future than we did in the late 1800's. There is quite an increase from 1920 to 1960,
		then a spike and peak in the 1960's.
