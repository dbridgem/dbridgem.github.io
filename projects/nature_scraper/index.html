	<h1>Nature Scraping</h1>
	<p>To see the actual code used, you can go to <a href="https://github.com/dbridgem/Nature-Scrape">my Github page</a>. What I
		did was use Beatiful Soup 4 to scrape Nature's journal archives, then extracted single tokens from the titles
		of publications from their "Letters" selection in 5 year windows to explore a bit. It was all done in Python
		with exception of the static plots below, where I've got a few insights extracted from the data.

	<h2>
		Certain words have become much more polular
	</h2>

	<p>	From this animated bar graph showing the most popular words over time, I found a few things interesting. First, you can see 
		that over time there are a few words that become popular and remain popular. Second, you can see that the most popular terms
		rotate very quickly towards the beginning of the publication, and later they stabilize a fair bit.

<div class="finding">
	<h2>
		Letter titles have gotten longer over time.
	</h2>
	<p><img style = "padding: 0 15px; float: left;" img src = "Title_Length.jpg" alt ="Image_Placeholder.png" height = 300 width = 300/>
		If we look at the average length of a title over time from published Letters, we can see a fairly steady increase from 
		about 4 words per title in 1874 to almost 11 words per title in 1984, when it stopped increasing.
</div>

<div class="finding">
	<h2>
		Nature doesn't publish many more Letters now than they did in the late 1800's
	</h2>
	<p><img style = "padding: 0 15px; float: left;" img src = "Num_Letters.jpg" alt ="Image_Placeholder.png"  height = 300 width = 300/>
		Looking at the volume of Letters that Nature published over time, we are currently seeing a long decrease, where we might 
		even expect to see a lower rate in the near future than we did in the late 1800's. There is quite an increase from 1920 to 1960,
		then a spike and peak in the 1960's.
</div>

<div class="finding">
	<h2>
		There is a fairly consistent trend between the number of words and number of unique words
	</h2>
	<p><img style = "padding: 0 15px; float: left;" img src = "WordsVUniquewords.jpg" alt ="Image_Placeholder.png"  height = 300 width = 300/>
		If we look at the total number of words from Nature Letters in a 5 year window, it correlates fairly well. Since we don't
		see much variance in the trend, it probably isn't changing too much over time. As we start to get more and more words 
		we do get a few less unique words per word published in a title, although it doesn't seem to be all that big of effect.
